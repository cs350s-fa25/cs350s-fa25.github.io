1. With differential privacy, the analyst needs to learn some useful information from the released statistic without learning too much information.

However, Alice may have clicked on many ads for running shoes. Epsilon differential privacy hides that she clicked on a particular ad, but might not adequately hide her general interest in running shoe ads.
