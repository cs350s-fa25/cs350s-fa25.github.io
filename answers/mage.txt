1. No, because in a plaintext database workload, the accesses are data-dependent, and so not known ahead of time.

2. No. MAGE can improve the overhead of reads and writes from memory, but does not decrease the network communication between parties. Therefore if network communication is the bottleneck for a MPC program, then reducing memory overheads with MAGE will not significantly impact performance.
