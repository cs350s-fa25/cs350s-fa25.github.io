            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Students will regularly submit answers to reading questions, and they will present a research paper once during the quarter.</p>

            <p>Students will also complete a research project where they build a privacy-preserving system. They will submit a project proposal
            midway through the quarter and a final report at the end of the quarter, and they will present their research project to the class
            during the last week of classes.</p>

            <h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Student participation (10%)</li>
                <li>Reading responses (15%)</li>
                <li>Paper presentation (20%)</li>
                <li>Final project proposal (5%)</li>
                <li>Final project progress report (5%)</li>
                <li>Final project presentation (20%)</li>
                <li>Final project report (25%)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Reading responses are due at <b>3:00 PM</b> on the day of class.
            For participation, we will grade on not only attendance, but also participation in class discussions.
            </p>

            <p>Students should submit reading responses and other assignments on Gradescope (entry code: ZYXEWZ).</p>

            <p>We will not accept late reading responses, but we will drop the two lowest reading response grades.
                Students can also miss two lectures without it affecting their participation grade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students may use an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT), but they should cite how they used the LLM.
                Students should explain how they prompted the LLM and include any text directly generated by an
                LLM in quotes (as with any other source).
                
                We will consider how LLMs were used when grading: if the LLM completed the ``challenging'' part
                of an assignment, then the student's grade may be affected.
                For example, prompting an LLM with the paper and the reading question, or some variant of the reading
                question, will not receive any credit (as this defeats the learning goals of the reading questions).
            </p>

            <h3>Students with documented disabilities</h3>
            <p>Students with a disability who need an academic accommodation should make a request to the
                Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) within the
                <a href="https://oae.stanford.edu/">Office of Accessible Education (OAE)</a>.
                The staff there will evaluate the request and prepare an accommodation letter for the
                instructor for the current quarter.
                Please make the request to SDRC as soon as possible to allow for time to arrange accommodations.

            <h3>Stanford student support</h3>
            <p>Stanford has excellent resources for students that need additional support during
                challenging times.
                If stress, anxiety, low mood, or other issues are impacting any
                part of your life,
                <a href="https://caps.stanford.edu/">CAPS</a> is a good resource.
                An overview of Stanford's mental health resources is available
